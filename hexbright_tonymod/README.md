In LMH Mode:
From off:
Short tap: Low > Short tap: Medium > Short tap: High > Short tap: Off

In HML Mode:
Short tap: High > Short tap: Medium > Short tap: Low > Short tap: Off

From off:
Long press: Dazzle > Short tap: Fast blink > Short tap: Slow blink > Short tap: Off

 To enter program mode, press and hold the button from the off mode. The light will go
 into Dazzle mode and then it will shut off after 4 seconds. When you release the button, the green
 LED on the back of the HexBright will either fade up for LMH mode or fade down for HML mode.
 When the green LED indicates the mode you want, press and hold the button for a half second to
 go to mode enable selection. In mode enable selection, the HexBright will first go to low or high,
 depending on the LMH/HML setting. The green LED will be lit if the mode is enabled and out if it is
 disabled. A tap of the button toggles the enabled/disabled status of the current mode, while a
 a 0.5 second press moves to the next mode. After slow blink mode, the light will save its settings
 if necessary, then turn off. 

A long press while any mode is activated will shut the HexBright off.
